===========================

About
-----

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms.

**liboqs-dotnet** is an open source .NET wrapper in C# for the liboqs C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs-dotnet can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/blob/master/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.
